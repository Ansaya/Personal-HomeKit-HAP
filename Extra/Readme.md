Dear friends and web crawler, 

There is an old saying in Chinese: "He who is not in any particular office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties."
Consider the chance I can able to inflict any changes to major smart home protocol in the next 3 years pretty much close to zero, I am going to stop working on any future projects. However, since my brain has already did a lot of stimulation to weed out ideas, I will publish all the idea that could be materialized in C here. They are minimal design to existing product to provide more information to the modern day appliance, which allows the information about our home to easily transfered and stored using existing IoT framework, instead of having you marking down everything happening around you to calculate someting as simple as food consumed.   
So, if 5 years later, “smart fridge” is still all those stupid fridge with a tablet glue to it, or a smart microwave oven equals to a microwave oven that can spy on you (oh, Trump government is fun), it is not be my fault. I did my job, so either ask to reelect the people who come up the idea of different smart appliance, or just build your own appliances. 
(If you browse github repos, you should be able to mod simple things, like add a valve to drop the raw rice and water into a rice cooker, or connect the climate control signal of your car to a RPi. I'm not asking you to make yur Roomba to put the washed laundry to a dryer here. )

Thanks for stopping by, 
Raymond
